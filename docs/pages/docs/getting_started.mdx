# Getting Started with Flexible
import { Callout, Tab, Tabs, Steps } from "nextra-theme-docs";

Here, we outline the process of forking the Flexible DAO Interfaces template and creating your own DAO site powered by an onchain theming contract.

Go to the Flexible DAO Interfaces website and copy the template. Once you have done this, you can customize your site by using the built-in theme editor. This will enable you to have full control over the appearance and functionality of your site.

## Quickstart 

<Steps>
### Start 

Click on the dash in the top right corner of the navigation bar will open a dropdown menu that gives you the option to connect your wallet or copy our template.

If you click on "Copy our template," you will be redirected to Vercel.

### Deploy to Vercel

In case you encounter difficulties with the interface, you can click the button below to fork the template and then connect to Vercel via GitHub.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fhello-world)

> If you donâ€™t have a GitHub account, follow our [Getting Started with GitHub](https://www.loom.com/share/b39dcc47d5724dbb937270191fc016a9) and [Vercel Setup](https://www.loom.com/share/457c57d0fbdc4801a5f4cede65faf167) tutorial. 

Create your new repository and make sure to name it the same as your DAO website name.

Once you've completed that step, the deploy process will prompt you to provide the requested environment variables, which are described below.

<OptionTable options={[
       ['NEXT_PUBLIC_DAO_ADDRESS', 'The Address of your Nouns Build DAO'],
       ['NEXT_PUBLIC_DAO_ADDRESS', 'The API key from your Alchemy dashboard.'],
       ['NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_INDEX', 'The index value of your platform theme contract']
      ]}/>


> [Follow these detailed instructions on how to retrieve an Alchemy API Key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfggWxfG9o0).

### Build

With your environment variables configured, you're now all set to deploy your project to Vercel.

When your project finishes building, youâ€™ll be redirected to a success screen and prompted to continue to your Vercel dashboard. 

Here you will be able to view you website by clicking on the autogenerated URL. 
</Steps>

## Customizing your DAO site

<Steps>
###  Connect Wallet
After deploying your new site, click on the dash located in the top right corner. This will prompt a dropdown menu to appear, which will allow you to connect your wallet.

After connecting your wallet, you will see a button labeled "Edit Theme."

> To access this, admin privileges are required. In case you haven't assigned any admins for your site, you can follow the new `platformIndex` setup guide.

### Theme Editor
This modal enables you to update your DAO website by utilizing data from an [onchain registry](/docs/theming/). You can reference a theming configuration for any address or contract owned by another address.

#### Presets 
There are 5 themes available from the registry: `Default`, `Light`, `Midori`, `Nouns`, `Obscura`, and `Slime`.

#### Advanced 

For more advanced customizations, you can create new themes and update the DAO site without needing any coding skills. You have the option to change colors of the text and background, modify buttons, borders, and border size, select fonts, and overall form unique branding for your DAO site. After editing the theme, you can to revert it back to default, or save changes.

**Saving changes to your theme**

If you wish to save your design, you will be updating the theme in the `themeRegistry`. As an admin this happens through a signed transaction that builds a new reference for the metadata your site relies on.  Upon signing a brand new `tokenURI` is initialized as a `newTheme` with the signer serving as the `themeAdmin`. Admins can assign additional managers for the site who are also able to make updates to the site's overall layout.
</Steps>

## Fork the Template

You can also manually [fork the template](https://github.com/public-assembly/flexible) repository.

## Add to Existing Project

This deployment is built on top of react componentry and hooks to interact with the [ourzora/nouns-protocol](https://github.com/ourzora/nouns-protocol) smart contracts. Currently you can include a simple auction widget in your react / nextjs projects with underlying hooks.
