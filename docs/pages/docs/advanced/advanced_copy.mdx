Included in this package are a set of React hooks and frontend components designed to allow anyone to spin up a website for their Nounish DAO. The hooks retrieve information from the Zora Nouns Protocol and pass it to an array of components that enable interactions with a DAO's auctions and proposals. Also included are a group of context providers that allow contract specific data to be easily retrieved and supplied anywhere throughout your app.
