## Public Assembly - DAO Utils ⌐◨-◨

React componentry and hooks to interact with the [ourzora/nouns-protocol](https://github.com/ourzora/nouns-protocol) smart contracts. Currently you can include a simple auction widget in your react / nextjs projects with underlying hooks. Many more features and far better architecture forthcoming! Designed to be included in a larger ethereum DAPP this library has numerous peer dependencies (optimizations coming).
