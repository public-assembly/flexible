Included in this package are a set of React hooks and frontend components designed to allow anyone to spin up a website for their Nounish DAO. The hooks retrieve information from the Zora Nouns Protocol and pass it to an array of components that enable interactions with a DAO's auctions and proposals. Also included are a group of context providers that allow contract specific data to be easily retrieved and supplied anywhere throughout your app.

## Hooks

| [CurrentAuction] | Displays information about a token auction, such as the current highest bid, remaining time, and highest bidder, and enables users to place a bid if authenticated by connecting to the Zora Nouns protocol.         |
| [TokenRenderer]  | Displays a two-column div element that shows DAO Art and settled auction information, including the title of the DAO NFT, token ID, current holder information, etc.                                                 |
| [TokenExplorer]  | Displays either the "CurrentAuction" or "TokenRenderer" component based on the state of "tokenId" and provides pagination of DAO NFTs, enabling users to flip back and forth between NFTs.                           |
